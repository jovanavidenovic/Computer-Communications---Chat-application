# Computer-Communications--Chat-App
The project done for the first-year course computer communications.

Instructions for using ChatServer.java and ChatClient.java:

Sending a public message: 
When the app asks you for a name of a recipient write EVERYONE.

Sending a private message:
When the app asks you for a name of a recipient, write the name of a person, 
you want to send a message to. 
If the name is not valid, you will get a message:  
User "username" does not exist. Try again with different username.

If you have already sent a message, you have to confirm 
that you want to send another one with typing YES.
